# Hello, guys!
Iâ€™m an ML Scientist at Concr, working on developing and applying machine learning modelling techniques to help identify and treat cancer. Previously, I worked in the UK oil & gas industry, where I focused on mathematical and numerical modelling and optimization studies. 

Besides, Iâ€™ve got academic experience in computational physics research software and deep learning for computer vision. I have an MSc in Engineering from Imperial College London and PhD in Computational Physics from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
