 # Portfolio - AI/ML/Computer Vision 

Hello, guys! I'm a Scientist in Machine Learning and Computational Science. Over the past 5 years, I've specialized in creating machine learning products for the biotechnology and energy industries. I love the intersection between science and real-world problems. I typically work on private repositories, but here are a few standout projects we've published:

## 1) 
Provide a brief description of the project, including its purpose, main features, and technologies used.

## 2) 
Provide a brief description of the project, including its purpose, main features, and technologies used.

## 3)
