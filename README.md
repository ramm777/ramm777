# Hello, guys!
I‚Äôm an ML Scientist at Concr, working on developing and applying machine learning modelling techniques to help identify and treat cancer. Previously, I worked in the UK oil & gas industry, where I focused on mathematical and numerical modelling and optimization studies. 

Besides, I‚Äôve got academic experience in computational physics research software and deep learning for computer vision. I have an MSc in Engineering from Imperial College London and PhD in Computational Physics from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. 

 Email: 77777aidan@gmail.com.


5 years of machine learning experience in a startup and academia in the UK, focusing on a product
3 years in research software development and 2.5 years in predictive modelling in global consulting
Canada Permanent Residency. Open to relocate.
