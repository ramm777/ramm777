 # Portfolio - AI/ML/Computer Vision 

Hello, guys! I'm a Scientist in Machine Learning and Computational Science. Over the past 5 years, I've specialized in creating machine learning products for the biotechnology and energy industries. I love the intersection between science and real-world problems. I typically work on private repositories, but here are a few standout projects we've published:

## 1) Integrated ML Predictor of Clinical Trials
We have developed a method that employs Bayesian statistics to accurately forecast the outcomes of clinical trials in the course of novel drug development. The development of an oncology drug currently incurs a cost exceeding Â£4 billion, given the high failure rate of approximately 95%. Our proposed Digital Twin can simulate a clinical trial and predict novel drug outcomes, thereby improving and mitigating risks in the clinical development of oncology therapeutics. 
- It uses multi-modal data: genetics (like RNAseq), clinical, image data and chemical compounds data
- We integrate XGBoost, Gaussian Process and Survival Modelling into one model
- We validate our model against past clinical trials and use standard ML validation methods

## 2) Use Computer Vision to Identify Cell Types on the Medical Images 
We developed a deep-learning model to identify types of cells (tumour cells, lymphs and fibroblasts) from the medical images. The model aimed to help pathologists who spend a lot of time diagnosing cancer and help other ML models in predicting treatment outcomes. The model was trained with annotated images from a breast cancer dataset and was validated by a pathologist. The results showed that the model could accurately identify the cells, especially TILs, which it identified even better than a pathologist.

We employed a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation, training the model on the NuCLS dataset annotated for cell types. The dataset, comprising images from the TCGA for breast cancer, was split into training and validation/testing sets. The model's performance was validated by an expert pathologist, demonstrating promising results with an AUROC of 0.864 and 0.901, along with balanced and standard accuracies. The model offers a tool that can enhance precision treatment by integrating it into complex predictive modelling systems. 


## 3) 
Provide a brief description of the project, including its purpose, main features, and technologies used.

working on developing and applying machine learning modelling techniques to help identify and treat cancer. Previously, I worked in the UK oil & gas industry, where I focused on mathematical and numerical modelling and optimization studies. 

Besides, Iâ€™ve got academic experience in computational physics research software and deep learning for computer vision. I have an MSc in Engineering from Imperial College London and PhD in Computational Physics from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
