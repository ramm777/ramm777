 # Portfolio - AI/ML/Computer Vision 

Hello, guys! I'm a Scientist in Machine Learning and Computational Science. Over the past 5 years, I've specialized in creating machine learning products for the biotechnology and energy industries. I love the intersection between science and real-world problems. I typically work on private repositories, but here are a few standout projects we've published:

## 1) Integrated ML Predictor of Clinical Trials
We have developed a method that employs Bayesian statistics to accurately forecast the outcomes of clinical trials in the course of novel drug development. The development of an oncology drug currently incurs a cost exceeding Â£4 billion, given the high failure rate of approximately 95%. Our proposed Digital Twin can simulate a clinical trial and predict novel drug outcomes, thereby improving and mitigating risks in the clinical development of oncology therapeutics. 
- It uses multi-modal data: genetics (like RNAseq), clinical, image data and chemical compounds data
- We integrate XGBoost, Gaussian Process and Survival Modelling into one model
- We validate our model against past clinical trials and use standard ML validation methods

working on developing and applying machine learning modelling techniques to help identify and treat cancer. Previously, I worked in the UK oil & gas industry, where I focused on mathematical and numerical modelling and optimization studies. 

Besides, Iâ€™ve got academic experience in computational physics research software and deep learning for computer vision. I have an MSc in Engineering from Imperial College London and PhD in Computational Physics from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
